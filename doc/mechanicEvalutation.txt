I want the player to redirect the robots with his or her sword
I want the player to damage and defeat the robots with his or her sword
I want the player to arrange four blue blocks to make a wall of ice
I want the player to arrange four green blocks to create teleporters to displace robots
I want the player to arrange four red blocks to make a high-powered hammer that will badly damage any robot with one hit
I want the player to arrange four yellow blocks to make a sticky goo on the floor that slows robots down
