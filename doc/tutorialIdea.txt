Teaching the player to play the game
-----------------------------------------
Throwing in all the game elements at can be frustrating for the player. Frustrating the player can be good if they try to grow and improve,
but nobody likes my games enough yet to do that. I'm not like Derek Yu or Miyamoto or someone cool.

The plan is to teach the elements of the game one-by-one to the player, kind of like Portal or Mario or any other game indie folks still like.
Once the player feels comfortable with each element, combining them together will seem interesting and perhaps earn me the "emergent gameplay
designer" badge.

Some blocks work well with certain enimies. The Super Hammer is really effective against Boxer Greg, while Glue works great on slowing down
the Shooter. By perhaps introducing a block-enemy pair for the first few levels, the game will seem more interesting.

This may be a drawback for experienced players, but hopefully they'll feel awesome clearing through the first inital waves.

First Four Waves:
------
WAVE 1: Only crawlers. Allows the player to get a good sense of swinging the sword.
WAVE 2: Crawlers, Shooters, and green blocks
WAVE 3: Crawlers, Boxer Gregs, and red blocks
WAVE 4: Crawlers, yellow blocks, and blue blocks. A lot of Crawlers are thrown at the player.
------

After the fourth wave, the enemies come in their default random setting.
