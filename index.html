        <h3>What is this place?</h3>

<p>Well done, good chum. This is the current homepage for Whimsy Block Go, a small hobby game by Daniel Savage. Whimsy Block Go is intended to be one or two player action game with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino">tetromino</a> and beat-em-up elements.</p>

<h2>How far are you along in design?</h2>

<p>There isn't really an engine, but you could say that the engine's done if you mean the core logic code. I'm still trying to get a core mechanic down though that feels fun. After that it needs boatloads of polish so people on indie sites will give constructive criticism.</p>

<h2>What's the technical setup?</h2>

<p>I'm coding it in C and SDL. The intended target platforms will be Windows and probably Mac OS X. Linux makes sense too. </p>
