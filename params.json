{"body":"### What's the deal?\r\nThis is the web page for Prince Protect, a game Dan wrote during the summer of 2012!\r\n\r\n### Okay, cool what's Prince Protect about?\r\nPrince Protect is an arcade-style, boyfriend-defense, action game where players play as princesses, attempting to keep their harem of princes away from evil ninjas.\r\n\r\n### Can I play it with a friend?\r\nYes! It has two-player co-op with keyboard support. You might want to use [Joy2Key](http://www.electracode.com/4/joy2key/JoyToKey%20English%20Version.htm) to get gamepads going. That's more fun, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n### Open source?\r\nYeah homie. Derive, learn, but do not sell. Better license coming later.","note":"Don't delete this file!
