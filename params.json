This is the current homepage for Whimsy Block Go, a small hobby game by Daniel Savage. Whimsy Block Go is intended to be one or two player action game with [tetromino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino) and beat-em-up elements.\r\n\r\n## How far are you along in design?\r\nThere isn't really an engine, but you could say that the engine's done if you mean the core logic code. I'm still trying to get a core mechanic down though that feels fun. After that it needs boatloads of polish so people on indie sites will give constructive criticism.\r\n\r\n## What's the technical setup?\r\nI'm coding it in C and SDL. The intended target platforms will be Windows and probably Mac OS X. Linux makes sense too. ","google":""}
